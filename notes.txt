missing 5 SNe Ia. Cami thinks they are may be outside photo-z fit area? 0.2 < z < 5?
all are fairly close to hosts, farthest is 0.54 arcsec (about 10 pix)



HST04Haw 07360
has a match id, but no data. The SFH file is missing, and it is missing from the parameter summary file.


Approach: The probabilty of a SN Ia at a given time t, is proportional
to the the star-formation rate, then convolved with the delay time from
then to now.
